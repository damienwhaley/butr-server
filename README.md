# BUTR

This is the repository for the Butr (Butr Universal Travel Reservations) system. It is still a work in progress, but is beyond the "proof of concept" stage, and hurtling towards a demo soon.

This repository holds the Node.js server component of the system. There is also a PHP client in a separate repository. Eventually there will be a collection of Drupal modules (available from Github and also drupal.org), and an Android client. In here you will find the Node.js code and the database creation script.

The project home page is found at [www.butr.org](http://www.butr.org). Like this project it is also a work in progress.
