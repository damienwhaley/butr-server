Node.js
=======

* clean up api_json have one check per line in all files.

* figure out check_session_alive where session extended but redis does not think so...
  it seems to allow you to execute a command and then it tels you it is not valid.
  need to check the logic for the session to ensure that when it is not valid
  that it will not allow you to execute and will bomb out straight away.

* change references to app settings to a fetch from config.

NEXT STEPS:

* think about replication as a target /replication. need replication keys and
  also new messages to do direct inserts on tables. Probably have p_replication_TableName
  for each table to make it simple. must be able to do mulitple inserts per
  command.
 
* think about workflow/trigger events
  
* try uploads with formidable and AJAX (ebay tech site talks about it).

* try static files with a static route
